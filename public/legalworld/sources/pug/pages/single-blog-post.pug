						h4 The marketing landscape evolves at what often seems like a bewildering pace. There are changes in consumer preferences. There are updates to search algorithms. And, we can't forget the frequent updates and features added to various social media channels.

						p For that reason, being a successful marketer today might appear to require a never-ending list of skills. Where do you need to excel -- content creation, social media, web analytics, or all of the above ... and more? In a perfect world, it would be possible to constantly maintain all of these skills at an expert level. But in reality, it's okay -- and helpful -- to prioritize. The question remains, however: What skills do marketers need the most to both keep up with the industry, and be good at their jobs?
						p Luckily, the infographic below from TEKsystems outlines five crucial skills - largely digital ones - that marketers need to succeed this year. It includes five of the major marketing spheres.

								p These spheres are Digital Advertising, Social Marketing, Website Design/Development, Content Development, and Mobile Marketing.

						p We're not suggesting that marketers need to become experts in every single one of these areas. However, if there's a specific area of marketing that interests you the most, or into which you'd like to move, understanding where you'll need to excel can help you get there much faster without trying to be the best in everything.
						p Plus, as your brand and the landscape continue to evolve, this list can serve as a good reference when you feel like you might need to brush up on certain skills, or at least become more aware of them when it's necessary. That way, in addition to honing your own skills, you can understand where you might need to focus team-building efforts.
