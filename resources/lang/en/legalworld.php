As a rule, there are several factors that can lead to business losses:
        <br> - Illiterate legal service of the enterprise;
        <br> - Incorrect execution of documents and contracts with partners, which leads to a decrease in expected profits, or even losses;
        <br> - Legal and accounting departments do not interact with each other properly.
        Often this situation leads to discord within the enterprise. <strong> Legal assistance is needed even in resolving conflicts between employers and employees. </strong> Therefore, you should not neglect such an important component of any business.',
